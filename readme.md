How to use the program


First enter the scientific name for AT LEAST 2 viruses (i.e. measles and mumps)
The questions come in a loop so to exit entering the names enter "qqq"

Second the program will generate a table with a Locus: <Locus Here> and the name of the entry <Definition>
Enter the Locus as the input, its helpful to just select one from each list. (The lists are separated by line breaks)
This is also done in a loop so to exit enter "qqq"

Next: Sit Back Relax and watch your data pour through (alternatively watch a movie because the fetching and blast results could take a while)
